description: This file contains the instructions about how to Search GenBank for the
  mammalian gene(s) mentioned in the literature, get the GenBank accession numbers
  of these genes, search FlyBase to identify Drosophila homologs and to find out more
  information on these genes ? CG number of the gene, coding and 5? and 3?-UTR sequences,
  and other information on the function of this gene. Also find out if it has alternative
  isoforms and search OpenBiosystems to find out if they carry RNAi clones of these
  genes, and get the clone ID and catalog number.
